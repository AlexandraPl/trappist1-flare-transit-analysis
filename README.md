# TRAPPIST-1 Flare–Transit Analysis

This repository contains the Python code and analysis framework developed as part of a 30 ECTS M.Sc. thesis project.  
The project investigates the effect of stellar flares on exoplanet transit light curves and the reliability of transmission spectra, with a focus on the TRAPPIST-1 system observed by JWST/NIRSpec.

## 📄 Project Overview
The code implements a simulation-like framework performing:
- Data preprocessing and flare identification  
- Synthetic transit injection (achromatic and chromatic cases)  
- Flare modeling based on Tovar Mendoza et al. (2022)  
- MCMC parameter estimation using `emcee`  
- Gaussian Process noise modeling using `george`  
- Bayesian model comparison with nested sampling (`ultranest`)

Full methodological details can be found in the accompanying thesis.

## 🧠 Development Notes
This code was written in **Python 3.11** using standard scientific libraries:  
`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `batman`, `emcee`, `george`, and `ultranest`.

Parts of the code were written with the assistance of **LLMs** for programming and documentation:
- [ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5)](https://openai.com/chatgpt)
- [Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic), via GitHub Copilot](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet)

All code was manually reviewed, tested, and validated by the author.
